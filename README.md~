# SCALE Transient Solution

Used as supporting program for Master's Thesis. The SCALE 6.1 code system is encased through the "batch6.1" command in the form of a Python wrapper. Important to note that no actual SCALE source code is exhibited here, only the generic structure of an input file, containing no limited or classified information. This program is primarily a pre- and post-processor for the resulting input and output text files.

Technically deprecated except for testing purposes due to a transition to use SERPENT as the primary calculational tool. See the SERPENT Transient Solution repository for that version.
